How to Play
The TicTacToe game is a two-player game, where players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.

The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.

The "Player 1" (X) starts the game, and the "Player 2" (O) follows.

To place a symbol, tap on the desired cell on the grid.

To reset the game and scores, click the "RESET" button.

To save the game state, click the "SAVE GAME" button. The game state will be automatically saved when the game is over or reset.
